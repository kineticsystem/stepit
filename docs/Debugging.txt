There is a very nice tool called CuteCom that can be used to talk to the Arduino with sequence of Hexadecimal numbers.

sudo apt install cutecom



There are two useful online tools to use when connecting to the Arduino using the Serial Monitor.

String to HEX online converter
https://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx

On-line CRC calculation and free library
https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/crc-calculation

With the first, you can copy and paste the text received in the Serial Monitor to convert it into a sequence of Hexadecimal numbers.

With the second you can calculate the CRC-16 of a sequence of Hexadecimal numbers.

Correct ready answer: 7e 00 3f 08 3f 7e

Wrong ready answer:   7e 00 10 3f 10 7e
