# Build stepit_hardware library.

# CMake does not need headers listed here and it is generally recommended not
# to add them to avoid additional maintenance burden.
# Unfortunately, QtCreator needs them to display them in the class view,
# for easily navigating between class and header files (F4) and for automatic
# code formatting.
# The time spent in the IDE is longer than the time spend maintaining this
# list, so we added the header files too.
